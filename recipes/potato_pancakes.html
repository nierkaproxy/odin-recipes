        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h5>
          Lithuanian Potato Pancakes, known as "Bulviniai Blynai," are a
          delightful Eastern European dish. Grated potatoes are mixed with
          spices and a touch of olive oil creating a batter that's pan-fried to
          crispy golden perfection. These pancakes boast a satisfying blend of
          textures, with a crispy exterior and a tender, flavorful interior.
          Serve them with a dollop of sour cream or applesauce for a traditional
          and comforting Lithuanian culinary experience.

          <h3>Recipe</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Peel all the potatoes, and then in a large bowl grate them with an
              electric potato grater machine, or if you dont have that, use
              regular grater.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 1,5 tablespoons of salt and 0,5
              teaspoon of black pepper and mix it well
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat up a large frying pan with some olive oil in it, so that the
              oil covers all of the pan surface area. And then after the pan is
              heated up, put 2-3 tablespoons of the batter for each pancake (try
              to make at least 4 in one pan). Cook until its golden brown, then
              flip it and do the same for the other side.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the pancakes are cooking, make the sauce. Finely chop your
              fresh dill, and in a bowl mix sour cream, curd, chopped dill and
              salt and pepper.
            </li>
          </ol>
